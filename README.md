# Setup

I wrote this using Python 3.12.6. Any recent version of Python 3 should work

Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the Flask app using `flask run`

# Notes

The handout said I should answer the questions in `summary.txt`, but I have put my answers in `summary.md` so that the text would wrap around making it easier to read.
